# PHP_Blog
In this project, I used a phpMyAdmin software tool to create a blog posting website template that works in conjunction with MySQL. Having MySQL database allows you to add, edit, or delete posts on the website.

To use it you need to install the project's folder inside the folder where your PHP server is located. For example, if you use Xampp, the root would be: xampp/htdocs
